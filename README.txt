Networks Project 2

I am aware that I am turning this in 3 days late and will be docked points for the delay. 

I am also aware that this project does not work very well. You can get the time it takes to reach the destination and thatâ€™s about it. I am out of time and there is not much more I can do for this project. I am sorry.



Other notes:

This project contains a very heavily modified version of the basic raw socket ping functionality written by Matthew Dixon Cowles, Jens Diemer, and Johannes Meyer. Little of their original code remains.
